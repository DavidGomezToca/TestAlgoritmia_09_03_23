- **Description :**

  During my interview with Sopra Steria, I had the opportunity to showcase my algorithmic skills through a custom-built coding test. This test was designed to evaluate my problem-solving abilities, algorithm design proficiency, and coding proficiency. Through a series of challenging problems, I demonstrated my capacity to analyze complex problems, devise efficient algorithms, and implement clean and scalable code solutions. The test provided a platform for me to showcase my technical acumen and highlight my passion for algorithmic problem-solving. Overall, the experience was rewarding and underscored my commitment to excellence in software development.
